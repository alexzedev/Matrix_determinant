The determinant of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra, with wide-ranging applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. It is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix and provides crucial information about the properties of the matrix, such as invertibility, linear independence of vectors, and the scaling factor of linear transformations represented by the matrix.
